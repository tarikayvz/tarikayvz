Hello! I'm Tarık Buğra AYVAZOĞLU, a Computer Engineering student.

I am a creative thinker, a problem solver, and an enthusiastic learner, dedicated to continually following the advancements in my field.

I keep it in c# java and ruby ​​languages.

Coding is more than just my profession, it's my passion. I thrive when I'm working with code, challenging myself to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions.

When I'm not immersed in coding, you can often find me exploring the latest technology trends or diving deep into new learning materials. 

I strongly believe in the importance of lifelong learning and strive to improve my skills and broaden my knowledge with each passing day.
